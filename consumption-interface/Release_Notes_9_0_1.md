# Known Issues

- For 8.0U3 installations: Occasionally, the plug-in may fail to load on the initial
attempt. To check if the plug-in has loaded correctly, click the **vSphere Client**
menu icon, then to **Administration** -> **Client** -> **Plug-ins**.
Check the Status column of the VMware Local Consumption Interface plug-in, and in case you see a *Plug-in
Configuration with Reverse Proxy failed.* message, reinstall the plug-in.

- You must uninstall version 1.0.x before using the 9.0.x version of LCI. Failure to do so will result in the interface not starting correctly when looking at the `Resources` tab for a namespace.

- The UI allows users to publish TKG cluster VMs that are currently deployed. The published image will not be usable and users should not leverage this feature for such VMs.

- Resource updates will not automatically refresh in the UI. Users need to use the reload button to refresh the views on the resources.

- For 8.0U3 installations, LCI will not support following features:
    - Retire TKC is not supported and hence the upgrade from 1.32.x --> 1.33.x for a TKC will fail.
    - Ability to configure a Windows node pool to use Group Managed Service Accounts.
    - Cluster class 3.4.0 or VKr 1.33.x and higher.

# Fixed Issues

- Storage classes in non stretch supervisor environments should be correctly populated to allow successful deployment of VM, VKS Clusters and Volumes.
