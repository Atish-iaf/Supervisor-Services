  longDescription: The Argo CD Operator manages the full lifecycle for Argo CD and
    its components. The operator's goal is to automate the tasks required when operating
    an Argo CD cluster. Beyond installation, the operator helps to automate the process
    of upgrading, backing up and restoring as needed and remove the human as much
    as possible. In addition, the operator aims to provide deep insights into the
    Argo CD environment by configuring Prometheus and Grafana to aggregate, visualize
    and expose the metrics already exported by Argo CD.
